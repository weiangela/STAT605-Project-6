# STAT605-Project-6

The folder 'Processing_Titles' contains codes and results on titles of documents.

The folder 'parallel' contains a test build for parallel jobs on CHTC. It was used for debugging.

The folder `data` contains the metadata csv file and our code for data preprocessing. 

Our data files are too large for github, so we uploaded most of them to Box (We should probably include instructor/TA to our Box and give a link)
