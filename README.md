# STAT605-Project-6

The folder `Processing_Titles` contains codes and results on titles of documents.

The folder `parallel` contains a test build for parallel jobs on CHTC. It was used for debugging.

The folder `data` contains the metadata csv file and our code for data preprocessing. 
Our data files are too large for github, so we uploaded most of them to Box: https://uwmadison.box.com/s/llfjhdef2cddhqvxpnxplel7i378wdo0
